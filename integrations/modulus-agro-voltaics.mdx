description: Physics-informed neural networks for solar + agriculture optimization

## Overview

NVIDIA Modulus Agro-Voltaics uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the food-energy nexus in arid refugee settlements. It optimizes solar panel placement to maximize electricity generation while maintaining precise micro-climates for crop production.

<Info>
  Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. Agrivoltaics (growing crops under solar panels) solves both problems simultaneously using physics-informed optimization.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. "Agrivoltaics" (growing crops under solar panels) is the solution, but it requires precise physics to balance shade and light.

**The Singularity:** Physics-Informed Crop-Energy Simulation.

**Deep Architecture:** Uses NVIDIA Modulus to solve the radiative transfer equations. It tilts the solar panels automatically throughout the day to maximize electricity generation while maintaining the exact humidity/shade needed for spinach or tomatoes underneath.

**Impact:** Solves food and energy insecurity simultaneously.

## Quick start

```python
from sustainability.modulus_agro_voltaics import AgroVoltaicController

# Initialize physics-informed controller
controller = AgroVoltaicController(
    location={"lat": 0.0512, "lng": 40.3129},
    climate_zone="semi-arid",
    solver="modulus_pinn"
)

# Optimize panel tilt for current conditions
optimization = controller.optimize_tilt(
    ambient_temp=35.2,
    crop_type="spinach",
    soil_moisture=0.15,
    time_of_day="10:30"
)

print(f"Optimal tilt angle: {optimization.tilt_angle}°")
print(f"Energy output: {optimization.energy_output}%")
print(f"Crop health: {optimization.crop_health}")
print(f"Micro-climate humidity: {optimization.humidity}%")

# Run daily optimization cycle
daily_schedule = controller.generate_daily_schedule(
    crop_type="tomatoes",
    energy_target_kwh=50,
    crop_growth_stage="flowering"
)

for hour, config in daily_schedule.items():
    print(f"{hour}:00 - Tilt: {config.tilt}°, Shade: {config.shade_percent}%")
```
