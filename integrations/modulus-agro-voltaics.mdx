## Overview

NVIDIA Modulus Agro-Voltaics uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the food-energy nexus in arid refugee settlements. It optimizes solar panel placement to maximize electricity generation while maintaining precise micro-climates for crop production.

<Info>
  Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. Agrivoltaics (growing crops under solar panels) solves both problems simultaneously using physics-informed optimization.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. "Agrivoltaics" (growing crops under solar panels) is the solution, but it requires precise physics to balance shade and light.

**The Singularity:** Physics-Informed Crop-Energy Simulation.

**Deep Architecture:** Uses NVIDIA Modulus to solve the radiative transfer equations. It tilts the solar panels automatically throughout the day to maximize electricity generation while maintaining the exact humidity/shade needed for spinach or tomatoes underneath.

**Impact:** Solves food and energy insecurity simultaneously.

## Quick start

```python
from sustainability.modulus_agro_voltaics import AgroVoltaicController

# Initialize physics-informed controller
controller = AgroVoltaicController(
    location={"lat": 0.0512, "lng": 40.3129},
    climate_zone="semi-arid",
    solver="modulus_pinn"
)

# Optimize panel tilt for current conditions
optimization = controller.optimize_tilt(
    ambient_temp=35.2,
    crop_type="spinach",
    soil_moisture=0.15,
    time_of_day="10:30"
)

print(f"Optimal tilt angle: {optimization.tilt_angle}°")
print(f"Energy output: {optimization.energy_output}%")
print(f"Crop health: {optimization.crop_health}")
print(f"Micro-climate humidity: {optimization.humidity}%")

# Run daily optimization cycle
daily_schedule = controller.generate_daily_schedule(
    crop_type="tomatoes",
    energy_target_kwh=50,
    crop_growth_stage="flowering"
)

for hour, config in daily_schedule.items():
    print(f"{hour}:00 - Tilt: {config.tilt}°, Shade: {config.shade_percent}%")
```

## Real-world scenario (Dadaab 2026)

**Scenario:** A 5-hectare plot in Hagadera camp needs to produce both electricity for a health clinic and fresh vegetables for 2,000 residents.

**Challenge:** Traditional solar farms produce energy but no food. Traditional farms produce food but require grid electricity for irrigation pumps. The settlement cannot afford both.

**Solution:** Modulus Agro-Voltaics optimizes dual land use:

1. **Physics modeling:** Modulus solves radiative transfer equations for Dadaab's latitude and climate
2. **Panel design:** 3-meter-high solar panels with 40% ground coverage
3. **Crop selection:** Spinach, tomatoes, and peppers (shade-tolerant, high-nutrition)
4. **Dynamic control:** Panels tilt throughout the day to balance energy and crop needs
5. **Water integration:** Reduced evaporation under panels cuts water usage by 30%

**Result:** 
- **Energy:** 150 kWh/day (powers clinic + cold storage)
- **Food:** 8 tons of vegetables/year (feeds 2,000 people)
- **Water savings:** 40,000 liters/month

## Physics-informed optimization

Modulus solves the radiative transfer equation to optimize panel tilt:

```
∂I(λ,Ω)/∂s = -σ_ext(λ)I(λ,Ω) + σ_sca(λ)∫P(Ω,Ω')I(λ,Ω')dΩ' + ε(λ)B(λ,T)
```

Where:
- `I(λ,Ω)` = Radiance at wavelength λ in direction Ω
- `σ_ext` = Extinction coefficient (panel shading)
- `σ_sca` = Scattering coefficient (diffuse light)
- `ε(λ)B(λ,T)` = Thermal emission from soil

This ensures crops receive optimal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) while maximizing panel efficiency.
