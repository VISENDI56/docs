description: Physics-informed neural networks for solar + agriculture optimization

## Overview

NVIDIA Modulus Agro-Voltaics uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the food-energy nexus in arid refugee settlements. It optimizes solar panel placement to maximize electricity generation while maintaining precise micro-climates for crop production.

<Info>
  Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. Agrivoltaics (growing crops under solar panels) solves both problems simultaneously using physics-informed optimization.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Dadaab is arid. Food and energy are scarce. "Agrivoltaics" (growing crops under solar panels) is the solution, but it requires precise physics to balance shade and light.

**The Singularity:** Physics-Informed Crop-Energy Simulation.

**Deep Architecture:** Uses NVIDIA Modulus to solve the radiative transfer equations. It tilts the solar panels automatically throughout the day to maximize electricity generation while maintaining the exact humidity/shade needed for spinach or tomatoes underneath.

**Impact:** Solves food and energy insecurity simultaneously.

## Quick start

```python
from sustainability.modulus_agro_voltaics import ModulusAgroVoltaics

# Initialize system
agro = ModulusAgroVoltaics(
    location={"lat": 0.0512, "lng": 40.3129},
    climate_zone="semi-arid"
)

# Optimize panel placement
result = agro.optimize_panel_placement({
    "field_dimensions": {"length_m": 100, "width_m": 50},
    "crop_type": "maize",
    "target_energy_kwh": 10000
})

print(f"Optimal configuration: {result.panel_layout}")
print(f"Expected crop yield: {result.crop_yield_kg}")
print(f"Water savings: {result.water_savings_liters}")
```
