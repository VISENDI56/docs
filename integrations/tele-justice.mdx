## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Refugees face complex legal issues (asylum status, disputes) but have no access to lawyers.

**The Singularity:** Secure Legal-LLM Enclaves.

**Deep Architecture:** A specialized Legal-LLM (trained on Kenyan and International Refugee Law) accessible via a privacy-hardened terminal. It helps users draft affidavits or understand their rights. The session is protected by Confidential Computing, so no state actor can spy on the legal strategy.

**Impact:** Access to justice for 200,000+ unrepresented people.

## Quick start

```python
from justice.tele_justice import LegalGuardian

# Initialize Legal-LLM enclave
guardian = LegalGuardian(
    node_id="JUSTICE-DADAAB-001",
    jurisdiction="UNHCR_REFUGEE_LAW",
    confidential_computing=True
)

# Start secure legal consultation
session = guardian.start_secure_session(
    user_zkp="ZKP_REFUGEE_001",
    case_type="asylum_appeal"
)

print(f"Session ID: {session.session_id}")
print(f"TEE attestation: {session.tee_attestation}")
print(f"Privacy level: {session.privacy}")

# Draft legal document
document = guardian.draft_affidavit(
    case_details={
        "case_type": "asylum_appeal",
        "grounds": "persecution_based_on_religion",
        "evidence": ["witness_statements", "medical_records"],
        "jurisdiction": "Kenya_Refugee_Act_2021"
    }
)

print(f"Document: {document.document}")
print(f"Legal citations: {document.citations}")
print(f"Privacy: {document.privacy}")

# Get legal advice
advice = guardian.get_legal_advice(
    question="What are my rights under the 1951 Refugee Convention?",
    context="asylum_seeker_kenya"
)

print(f"Advice: {advice.answer}")
print(f"Legal basis: {advice.legal_framework}")
print(f"Next steps: {advice.recommended_actions}")
```
