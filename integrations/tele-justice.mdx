## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Refugees face complex legal issues (asylum status, disputes) but have no access to lawyers.

**The Singularity:** Secure Legal-LLM Enclaves.

**Deep Architecture:** A specialized Legal-LLM (trained on Kenyan and International Refugee Law) accessible via a privacy-hardened terminal. It helps users draft affidavits or understand their rights. The session is protected by Confidential Computing, so no state actor can spy on the legal strategy.

**Impact:** Access to justice for 200,000+ unrepresented people.

## Quick start

```python
from justice.tele_justice import TeleJusticeNode

# Initialize node
node = TeleJusticeNode(
    node_id="JUSTICE-DADAAB-001",
    jurisdiction="UNHCR_REFUGEE_LAW"
)

# Create case
case = node.create_case({
    "case_type": "family_reunification",
    "plaintiff": "REFUGEE-001",
    "description": "Family reunification request"
})

# Schedule hearing
node.schedule_hearing(
    case_id=case.case_id,
    participants=["REFUGEE-001", "LEGAL_AID_OFFICER"]
)

# Record verdict
node.record_verdict(
    case_id=case.case_id,
    verdict={"decision": "APPROVED", "reasoning": "..."}
)
```
