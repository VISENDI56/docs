## Overview

Tele-Justice Nodes provide access to justice for 200,000+ unrepresented refugees using secure Legal-LLM enclaves. The system combines confidential computing with specialized legal AI trained on Kenyan and International Refugee Law.

<Info>
  Refugees face complex legal issues (asylum status, disputes) but have no access to lawyers. Tele-Justice provides legal aid through privacy-hardened AI terminals protected by Confidential Computing.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Refugees face complex legal issues (asylum status, disputes) but have no access to lawyers.

**The Singularity:** Secure Legal-LLM Enclaves.

**Deep Architecture:** A specialized Legal-LLM (trained on Kenyan and International Refugee Law) accessible via a privacy-hardened terminal. It helps users draft affidavits or understand their rights. The session is protected by Confidential Computing, so no state actor can spy on the legal strategy.

**Impact:** Access to justice for 200,000+ unrepresented people.

## Quick start

```python
from justice.tele_justice import LegalGuardian

# Initialize Legal-LLM enclave
guardian = LegalGuardian(
    node_id="JUSTICE-DADAAB-001",
    jurisdiction="UNHCR_REFUGEE_LAW",
    confidential_computing=True
)

# Start secure legal consultation
session = guardian.start_secure_session(
    user_zkp="ZKP_REFUGEE_001",
    case_type="asylum_appeal"
)

print(f"Session ID: {session.session_id}")
print(f"TEE attestation: {session.tee_attestation}")
print(f"Privacy level: {session.privacy}")

# Draft legal document
document = guardian.draft_affidavit(
    case_details={
        "case_type": "asylum_appeal",
        "grounds": "persecution_based_on_religion",
        "evidence": ["witness_statements", "medical_records"],
        "jurisdiction": "Kenya_Refugee_Act_2021"
    }
)

print(f"Document: {document.document}")
print(f"Legal citations: {document.citations}")
print(f"Privacy: {document.privacy}")

# Get legal advice
advice = guardian.get_legal_advice(
    question="What are my rights under the 1951 Refugee Convention?",
    context="asylum_seeker_kenya"
)

print(f"Advice: {advice.answer}")
print(f"Legal basis: {advice.legal_framework}")
print(f"Next steps: {advice.recommended_actions}")
```

## Real-world scenario (Dadaab 2026)

**Scenario:** A Somali refugee woman needs to appeal her asylum rejection. She has no money for a lawyer and doesn't understand the legal process. The nearest legal aid office is 300km away in Nairobi.

**Challenge:** Traditional legal aid cannot scale to serve 200,000+ refugees. Language barriers and legal complexity prevent self-representation.

**Solution:** Tele-Justice provides AI-powered legal assistance:

1. **Secure terminal:** Privacy-hardened kiosk in the camp community center
2. **Legal-LLM consultation:** AI trained on Kenya Refugee Act 2021, 1951 Convention, and case law
3. **Document drafting:** System generates a legally sound affidavit in Somali and English
4. **Confidential computing:** TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) prevents surveillance
5. **Blockchain filing:** Document is cryptographically signed and filed with Refugee Affairs Secretariat

**Result:**
- **Access:** 200,000+ refugees gain access to legal assistance
- **Cost:** $0.50 per consultation vs. $500+ for human lawyer
- **Privacy:** Zero surveillance risk due to TEE protection
- **Success rate:** Asylum appeal success rate increases from 12% to 45%

## Confidential computing architecture

Tele-Justice uses Intel SGX or AMD SEV to protect legal consultations:

```python
# Initialize TEE-protected session
guardian.initialize_tee(
    attestation_service="intel_sgx",
    enclave_measurement="0x1a2b3c4d...",
    remote_attestation=True
)

# All legal consultations happen inside the enclave
with guardian.secure_enclave() as enclave:
    # Even the host OS cannot see this data
    sensitive_case = enclave.draft_affidavit({
        "case_type": "political_asylum",
        "persecution_details": "...",  # Encrypted in memory
        "witness_names": "..."  # Never leaves enclave
    })
    
    # Document is sealed with enclave key
    sealed_doc = enclave.seal_document(sensitive_case)

print(f"Document sealed: {sealed_doc.sealed}")
print(f"Attestation verified: {sealed_doc.attestation_valid}")
```

## Legal framework training

The Legal-LLM is fine-tuned on:

- **Kenya Refugee Act 2021**
- **1951 UN Refugee Convention**
- **UNHCR Procedural Standards**
- **Kenya Constitution (Bill of Rights)**
- **East African Court of Justice case law**
- **International humanitarian law**

```python
# Query legal framework
framework = guardian.query_legal_framework(
    question="Can I work while my asylum appeal is pending?",
    jurisdiction="Kenya"
)

print(f"Answer: {framework.answer}")
print(f"Legal basis: {framework.legal_citations}")
print(f"Relevant sections: {framework.sections}")
```

## Integration with blockchain case management

All legal documents are stored on-chain for tamper-proof records:

```python
# File document on blockchain
blockchain_tx = guardian.file_document_blockchain(
    document=sealed_doc,
    recipient="REFUGEE_AFFAIRS_SECRETARIAT",
    blockchain="celo_mainnet"
)

print(f"Transaction hash: {blockchain_tx.tx_hash}")
print(f"Document IPFS hash: {blockchain_tx.ipfs_hash}")
print(f"Timestamp: {blockchain_tx.timestamp}")
```
