title: Knowledge Mesh Education System
description: Decentralized offline-first education for health workers
---

## Overview

Knowledge Mesh is a sovereign AI tutor system providing offline-first education for refugee youth and health workers. It uses local-LLM education agents (NIMs) to democratize high-quality education without internet costs.

<Info>
  Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth. Knowledge Mesh provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students simultaneously.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth.

**The Singularity:** Local-LLM Education Agents (NIMs).

**Deep Architecture:** A quantized LLaMA-3 or similar model fine-tuned on the Kenyan Curriculum (CBC), hosted on the local IGX Orin. It provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students via the 6G Ghost-Mesh on low-cost tablets, even offline.

**Impact:** Democratizes high-quality education without internet costs.

## Quick start

```python
from education.knowledge_mesh import SovereignTutor

# Initialize local AI tutor
tutor = SovereignTutor(
    model="llama3-8b-cbc-finetuned",
    device="igx_orin",
    mesh_network="ghost_mesh_dadaab"
)

# Generate personalized lesson
lesson = tutor.generate_lesson(
    subject="mathematics",
    grade_level=8,
    student_profile={
        "language": "somali_english_mixed",
        "learning_style": "visual",
        "previous_scores": {"algebra": 65, "geometry": 78}
    }
)

print(f"Lesson plan: {lesson.lesson_plan}")
print(f"Language: {lesson.language}")
print(f"Estimated duration: {lesson.duration_minutes} minutes")

# Adaptive assessment
assessment = tutor.assess_student(
    student_id="STUDENT-AMINA-001",
    subject="mathematics",
    adaptive=True
)

print(f"Competency level: {assessment.competency_level}")
print(f"Recommended next topic: {assessment.next_topic}")
print(f"Learning gaps: {assessment.gaps}")
```
