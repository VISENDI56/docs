title: Knowledge Mesh Education System
description: Decentralized offline-first education for health workers
---

## Overview

Knowledge Mesh is a sovereign AI tutor system providing offline-first education for refugee youth and health workers. It uses local-LLM education agents (NIMs) to democratize high-quality education without internet costs.

<Info>
  Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth. Knowledge Mesh provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students simultaneously.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth.

**The Singularity:** Local-LLM Education Agents (NIMs).

**Deep Architecture:** A quantized LLaMA-3 or similar model fine-tuned on the Kenyan Curriculum (CBC), hosted on the local IGX Orin. It provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students via the 6G Ghost-Mesh on low-cost tablets, even offline.

**Impact:** Democratizes high-quality education without internet costs.

## Quick start

```python
from education.knowledge_mesh import KnowledgeMesh

# Initialize mesh node
mesh = KnowledgeMesh(
    node_id="NODE-DADAAB-001",
    sovereignty_zone="KDPA_KE"
)

# Create learning module
mesh.create_learning_module({
    "module_id": "CHOLERA-RESPONSE-101",
    "title": "Cholera Response Basics",
    "language": "swahili",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "competencies": ["diagnosis", "treatment", "prevention"]
})

# Assess competency
result = mesh.assess_competency(
    learner_id="CHV-AMINA",
    skill="cholera_diagnosis"
)
print(f"Competency level: {result.level}")
```
