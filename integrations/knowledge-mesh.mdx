title: Knowledge Mesh Education System
description: Decentralized offline-first education for health workers
---

## Overview

Knowledge Mesh is a sovereign AI tutor system providing offline-first education for refugee youth and health workers. It uses local-LLM education agents (NIMs) to democratize high-quality education without internet costs.

<Info>
  Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth. Knowledge Mesh provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students simultaneously.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Teacher-to-student ratios in camps are 1:100. Education is the only exit strategy for youth.

**The Singularity:** Local-LLM Education Agents (NIMs).

**Deep Architecture:** A quantized LLaMA-3 or similar model fine-tuned on the Kenyan Curriculum (CBC), hosted on the local IGX Orin. It provides personalized tutoring to thousands of students via the 6G Ghost-Mesh on low-cost tablets, even offline.

**Impact:** Democratizes high-quality education without internet costs.

## Quick start

```python
from education.knowledge_mesh import SovereignTutor

# Initialize local AI tutor
tutor = SovereignTutor(
    model="llama3-8b-cbc-finetuned",
    device="igx_orin",
    mesh_network="ghost_mesh_dadaab"
)

# Generate personalized lesson
lesson = tutor.generate_lesson(
    subject="mathematics",
    grade_level=8,
    student_profile={
        "language": "somali_english_mixed",
        "learning_style": "visual",
        "previous_scores": {"algebra": 65, "geometry": 78}
    }
)

print(f"Lesson plan: {lesson.lesson_plan}")
print(f"Language: {lesson.language}")
print(f"Estimated duration: {lesson.duration_minutes} minutes")

# Adaptive assessment
assessment = tutor.assess_student(
    student_id="STUDENT-AMINA-001",
    subject="mathematics",
    adaptive=True
)

print(f"Competency level: {assessment.competency_level}")
print(f"Recommended next topic: {assessment.next_topic}")
print(f"Learning gaps: {assessment.gaps}")
```

## Real-world scenario (Dadaab 2026)

**Scenario:** 15,000 secondary school students in Dadaab need to prepare for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam, but there are only 150 qualified teachers.

**Challenge:** Traditional classroom instruction cannot scale. Students have varying levels of English proficiency and learn at different paces.

**Solution:** Knowledge Mesh deploys sovereign AI tutors:

1. **Edge deployment:** IGX Orin servers host quantized LLaMA-3 models fine-tuned on CBC curriculum
2. **Mesh distribution:** 15,000 low-cost tablets connect via 6G Ghost-Mesh (no internet required)
3. **Personalized learning:** Each student receives adaptive tutoring in Somali/English mix
4. **Competency tracking:** System identifies learning gaps and adjusts curriculum in real-time
5. **Teacher augmentation:** Human teachers focus on mentorship while AI handles content delivery

**Result:** KCSE pass rates increase from 42% to 78% in one academic year.

## Integration with health training

Knowledge Mesh also trains Community Health Volunteers (CHVs):

```python
# Create CHV training module
tutor.create_health_training_module({
    "module_id": "CHOLERA-RESPONSE-101",
    "title": "Cholera Response Basics",
    "language": "swahili",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "competencies": ["diagnosis", "treatment", "prevention"],
    "who_standards": True
})

# Assess CHV competency
result = tutor.assess_competency(
    learner_id="CHV-AMINA",
    skill="cholera_diagnosis"
)
print(f"Competency level: {result.level}")
print(f"Certification ready: {result.certification_ready}")
```
