title: Water-ATM Sovereignty
description: Blockchain-based sovereign water distribution with biometric authentication
---

## Overview

Water-ATM Sovereignty provides IoT-triggered smart contract water distribution that eliminates water cartels and guarantees fair access. It combines flow meters, ZKP identity verification, and ReFi (Regenerative Finance) to ensure transparent, corruption-free water access.

<Info>
  Water trucking in camps is expensive and corruptible. Water-ATMs use smart contracts to pay providers instantly in "Bio-Credits," cutting out middlemen and ensuring pumps are maintained.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Water trucking is expensive and corruptible.

**The Singularity:** IoT-Flow + ReFi Oracle.

**Deep Architecture:** Smart "Water ATMs" dispense water based on ZKP Identity scans. The flow meter (IoT) triggers a Smart Contract that pays the water provider instantly in "Bio-Credits," cutting out middlemen and ensuring the pump is maintained.

**Impact:** Eliminates water cartels and guarantees fair access.

## Quick start

```python
from infrastructure.water_atm import WaterATMSovereignty

# Initialize ATM
atm = WaterATMSovereignty(
    atm_id="ATM-DADAAB-001",
    location={"lat": 0.0512, "lng": 40.3129}
)

# Authenticate user
auth_result = atm.authenticate_user({
    "biometric_type": "fingerprint",
    "biometric_data": fingerprint_data
})

# Dispense water
if auth_result.authenticated:
    atm.dispense_water(
        user_id=auth_result.user_id,
        liters=20
    )

# Monitor quality
quality = atm.monitor_water_quality()
print(f"pH: {quality.ph}, TDS: {quality.tds_ppm}")
```
