title: Water-ATM Sovereignty
description: Blockchain-based sovereign water distribution with biometric authentication
---

## Overview

Water-ATM Sovereignty provides IoT-triggered smart contract water distribution that eliminates water cartels and guarantees fair access. It combines flow meters, ZKP identity verification, and ReFi (Regenerative Finance) to ensure transparent, corruption-free water access.

<Info>
  Water trucking in camps is expensive and corruptible. Water-ATMs use smart contracts to pay providers instantly in "Bio-Credits," cutting out middlemen and ensuring pumps are maintained.

## Civilization-scale singularity

**The Context:** Water trucking is expensive and corruptible.

**The Singularity:** IoT-Flow + ReFi Oracle.

**Deep Architecture:** Smart "Water ATMs" dispense water based on ZKP Identity scans. The flow meter (IoT) triggers a Smart Contract that pays the water provider instantly in "Bio-Credits," cutting out middlemen and ensuring the pump is maintained.

**Impact:** Eliminates water cartels and guarantees fair access.

## Quick start

```python
from infrastructure.water_atm import WaterATM

# Initialize smart water dispenser
atm = WaterATM(
    atm_id="ATM-DADAAB-001",
    location={"lat": 0.0512, "lng": 40.3129},
    blockchain_network="celo_mainnet"
)

# Authenticate user with ZKP
auth_result = atm.authenticate_zkp(
    user_zkp_proof="ZKP_PROOF_HASH_001"
)

# Dispense water and trigger smart contract
if auth_result.verified:
    transaction = atm.dispense_water(
        user_zkp=auth_result.user_zkp,
        liters=20
    )
    
    print(f"Valve status: {transaction.valve_status}")
    print(f"Smart contract TX: {transaction.transaction_hash}")
    print(f"Bio-Credits paid: {transaction.credits_paid}")
    print(f"Provider wallet: {transaction.provider_wallet}")

# Monitor water quality in real-time
quality = atm.monitor_water_quality()
print(f"pH: {quality.ph}")
print(f"TDS: {quality.tds_ppm} ppm")
print(f"Chlorine: {quality.chlorine_ppm} ppm")
print(f"Safe to drink: {quality.safe}")
```
