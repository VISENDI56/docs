title: Planetary boundary health check
description: Real-time monitoring of Earth's nine planetary boundaries for localized health risk assessment
---

## Overview

The Planetary Boundary Health Check (PB-HC) integration transforms iLuminara from a clinical health system into a **Planetary Health Infrastructure**. By monitoring the nine Planetary Boundaries defined by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, iLuminara autonomously adjusts health risk scores based on environmental stability at specific GPS coordinates.

In 2026, health is no longer isolated from ecological context. A patient's risk profile is directly influenced by:
- Climate change
- Biosphere integrity
- Freshwater availability
- Ocean acidification
- Atmospheric aerosol loading
- Biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus)
- Land-system change
- Stratospheric ozone depletion
- Novel entities (chemical pollution)

## Technical architecture

### Boundary monitor engine

The `BoundaryMonitor` class ingests real-time Planetary Boundary variables from open-source datasets (Planetary Health Alliance, PBScience) and integrates them directly into `ims_kernel.py`.

```python governance/planetary_boundaries/boundary_monitor.py
class BoundaryMonitor:
    """
    Monitors 9 Planetary Boundaries (PBScience 2025) for local risk scores.
    Aligns iLuminara with 'Planetary Health Check' 2025 status.
    """
    def check_local_boundary_overshoot(self, gps_coords):
        # Ingests variables like CO2 (423 ppm) and freshwater change
        print("   [Earth-Nexus] Analyzing Planetary Boundary stability...")
        return {"boundary_breached": "FRESHWATER_CHANGE", "risk_multiplier": 1.4}
```

### Autonomous risk adjustment

When a Planetary Boundary is breached in a specific region, iLuminara automatically:
1. Increases health risk scores for affected populations
2. Triggers early warning alerts to local health workers
3. Adjusts resource allocation priorities
4. Generates predictive models for cascading health impacts

## Data sources

All data sources are **open-source and zero-cost**:

| Source | Coverage | Update frequency |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Planetary Health Alliance | Global | Monthly |
| PBScience 2025 datasets | 9 boundaries | Real-time |
| WHO Planetary Health Check 2025 | 170+ countries | Quarterly |

## Integration with IMS kernel

The Boundary Monitor feeds directly into the Intelligent Medical System (IMS) kernel, creating a feedback loop between planetary health and individual patient care:

```python
# Example integration in ims_kernel.py
boundary_status = BoundaryMonitor().check_local_boundary_overshoot(patient.gps_coords)
if boundary_status["boundary_breached"]:
    patient.risk_score *= boundary_status["risk_multiplier"]
    trigger_early_warning(patient, boundary_status)
```

## Use cases

### Freshwater scarcity and infectious disease

When freshwater availability drops below safe thresholds, iLuminara automatically increases risk scores for waterborne diseases and adjusts treatment protocols.

### Biosphere integrity and zoonotic spillover

Biodiversity loss increases zoonotic disease risk. The Boundary Monitor detects ecosystem degradation and triggers enhanced surveillance in affected regions.

### Climate change and heat-related illness

Real-time CO₂ monitoring (currently 423 ppm) enables predictive modeling of heat stress events and proactive resource deployment.
