title: PABS pathogen sovereignty
description: Automated benefit-sharing protocol for genomic data under the WHO Pandemic Treaty 2026
---

## Overview

The Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing (PABS) Singularity prevents **digital bio-piracy** by enforcing the WHO Pandemic Treaty 2026 requirements directly within iLuminara's sovereign guardrail architecture.

When iLuminara detects a new pathogen variant, the genomic data is cryptographically locked until a verified benefit-sharing contract is established. This ensures that local communities retain sovereignty over their biological data and receive equitable benefits from any resulting research or treatments.

## The 2026 context

Global health politics are now defined by data sovereignty battles:
- 170+ countries demand equitable access to pandemic countermeasures
- Genomic data from the Global South has historically been extracted without compensation
- The WHO Pandemic Treaty mandates benefit-sharing for pathogen genetic sequence data (GSD)
- Digital bio-piracy threatens to replicate colonial extraction patterns in the genomic era

## Technical architecture

### PABS guardrail

The `PABSGuardrail` class integrates into `sovereign_guardrail.py` to enforce benefit-sharing requirements at the data access layer.

```python governance/pabs_protocol/benefit_sharing.py
class PABSGuardrail:
    """
    Enforces WHO Pandemic Treaty 2026 benefit-sharing requirements.
    Prevents digital bio-piracy of regional genomic data.
    """
    def authorize_genomic_export(self, researcher_id, benefit_sharing_contract):
        if not benefit_sharing_contract:
            print("   [PABS] ERROR: Benefit sharing agreement missing. Locking data.")
            return "ACCESS_DENIED"
        return "SOVEREIGN_RELEASE"
```

### Cryptographic data locking

When a new variant is detected:
1. Genomic sequence data is immediately encrypted
2. Access control is transferred to the Regenerative Compliance Oracle (RCO)
3. Data remains locked until benefit-sharing terms are verified
4. Smart contracts automate royalty distribution to source communities

### Regenerative compliance oracle

The RCO validates benefit-sharing agreements against:
- WHO Pandemic Treaty requirements
- Nagoya Protocol standards
- Local community consent protocols
- Fair and equitable benefit distribution mechanisms

## Integration workflow

```python
# Example detection and locking workflow
new_variant = pathogen_detector.analyze_sample(sample_id)

if new_variant.is_novel:
    # Cryptographically lock genomic data
    pabs_guardrail = PABSGuardrail()
    genomic_data = encrypt_and_lock(new_variant.sequence)
    
    # Require benefit-sharing contract before release
    access_status = pabs_guardrail.authorize_genomic_export(
        researcher_id=request.researcher,
        benefit_sharing_contract=request.contract
    )
    
    if access_status == "SOVEREIGN_RELEASE":
        release_data_with_tracking(genomic_data, request.contract)
```

## Benefit-sharing mechanisms

### Monetary benefits
- Royalties from diagnostic tests
- Licensing fees for therapeutics
- Revenue sharing from vaccines

### Non-monetary benefits
- Technology transfer to source countries
- Capacity building for local researchers
- Priority access to resulting countermeasures
- Co-authorship on publications

## Policy enforcement

The PABS protocol is **logic-based and zero-cost**, requiring no external infrastructure:

| Component | Function | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Cryptographic locking | Prevents unauthorized access | $0 |
| Smart contract validation | Automates benefit verification | $0 |
| Compliance oracle | Enforces treaty requirements | $0 |
| Audit trail | Immutable access logs | $0 |

## Sovereignty guarantees

### Data ownership
Local communities retain full ownership of genomic data originating from their region.

### Consent protocols
No data export without explicit, informed consent from source communities.

### Equitable access
Source communities receive priority access to any diagnostics, treatments, or vaccines developed from their data.

### Transparency
All data access requests and benefit-sharing agreements are recorded on an immutable audit trail.

## Implementation cost

**$0** — Pure logic-based policy enforcement with no external dependencies.
