title: TCIM traditional knowledge
description: Integration of 170+ countries' traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine systems
---

## Overview

The 2026 global health landscape recognizes that **170 countries use Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM)** as primary or complementary healthcare. Western biomedical models alone cannot serve the majority of the world's population.

The TCIM Global Library Adapter ingests evidence-based traditional medicine knowledge into iLuminara's Semantic Sovereignty layer, enabling **Cultural Health Heritage** innovations that conventional AI systems ignore.

## The knowledge gap

### Western-only AI models
- Trained exclusively on biomedical literature
- Ignore 5,000+ years of traditional medical knowledge
- Culturally inappropriate for most global populations
- Miss effective treatments used by billions

### TCIM-integrated AI
- Respects diverse healing traditions
- Validates traditional knowledge with evidence
- Culturally appropriate care recommendations
- Bridges traditional and modern medicine

## Technical architecture

### TCIM global library adapter

The adapter interfaces with WHO's TCIM Global Library to ingest structured traditional medicine knowledge:

```python governance/tcim/knowledge_adapter.py
class TCIMAdapter:
    """
    Ingests 170+ countries' evidence-based traditional medicine 
    into iLuminara's Semantic Sovereignty layer.
    """
    def ingest_traditional_knowledge(self, country_code, condition):
        # Query WHO TCIM Global Library API
        tcim_data = self.who_api.query_tcim(
            country=country_code,
            condition=condition,
            evidence_level="validated"
        )
        
        # Integrate with biomedical knowledge graph
        integrated_knowledge = self.semantic_layer.merge(
            traditional=tcim_data,
            biomedical=self.biomedical_kg.query(condition)
        )
        
        return integrated_knowledge
```

### Semantic sovereignty layer

The Semantic Sovereignty layer ensures traditional knowledge is:
1. **Attributed** — Source communities receive credit
2. **Protected** — Sacred knowledge remains confidential
3. **Validated** — Evidence standards applied consistently
4. **Integrated** — Linked to biomedical knowledge graphs

## Knowledge categories

### Herbal medicine

Evidence-based phytotherapy from traditional systems:
- **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** — 13,000+ medicinal plants
- **Ayurveda** — 7,000+ plant-based formulations
- **African traditional medicine** — 5,000+ indigenous plants
- **Indigenous American medicine** — 2,500+ traditional remedies

### Manual therapies

Physical interventions with clinical evidence:
- **Acupuncture** — Pain management, nausea, addiction
- **Massage therapy** — Musculoskeletal conditions, stress
- **Chiropractic** — Back pain, headaches
- **Osteopathy** — Chronic pain, mobility

### Mind-body practices

Integrative approaches with mental health benefits:
- **Meditation** — Anxiety, depression, PTSD
- **Yoga** — Chronic pain, cardiovascular health
- **Tai Chi** — Balance, fall prevention, arthritis
- **Qigong** — Stress reduction, immune function

### Traditional diagnostic systems

Non-Western diagnostic frameworks:
- **Pulse diagnosis** — TCM, Ayurveda, Tibetan medicine
- **Tongue diagnosis** — Pattern recognition in TCM
- **Constitutional typing** — Ayurvedic doshas, TCM patterns
- **Energy assessment** — Qi, prana, vital force concepts

## Evidence validation

### WHO evidence standards

TCIM knowledge is validated against WHO's evidence framework:

| Evidence level | Criteria | Integration |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Systematic reviews, meta-analyses | Full integration |
| Level 2 | Randomized controlled trials | Conditional integration |
| Level 3 | Observational studies | Supplementary information |
| Level 4 | Traditional use, expert opinion | Cultural context only |

### Safety monitoring

Traditional remedies are screened for:
- **Drug interactions** — Herb-drug interactions
- **Contraindications** — Pregnancy, chronic conditions
- **Adverse effects** — Known toxicities
- **Quality control** — Contamination, adulteration

## Cultural appropriateness

### Respecting traditional knowledge

The TCIM adapter implements safeguards against cultural appropriation:

```python
# Example cultural protection
def recommend_treatment(patient, condition):
    # Check patient's cultural background
    cultural_context = patient.cultural_identity
    
    # Only recommend TCIM from patient's own tradition
    # unless explicitly requested otherwise
    if cultural_context in ["Chinese", "East Asian"]:
        tcim_options = tcim_adapter.query(tradition="TCM")
    elif cultural_context in ["Indian", "South Asian"]:
        tcim_options = tcim_adapter.query(tradition="Ayurveda")
    
    # Always offer biomedical options alongside TCIM
    biomedical_options = biomedical_kg.query(condition)
    
    return {
        "traditional": tcim_options,
        "biomedical": biomedical_options,
        "integrated": integrate_approaches(tcim_options, biomedical_options)
    }
```

### Indigenous data sovereignty

For Indigenous traditional knowledge:
- **CARE principles** — Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics
- **OCAP principles** — Ownership, Control, Access, Possession
- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)** — Required for all knowledge use

## Integration with biomedical AI

### Hybrid treatment recommendations

iLuminara provides integrated treatment plans that combine traditional and modern approaches:

```python
# Example hybrid recommendation
patient = Patient(
    condition="chronic_pain",
    cultural_background="Chinese",
    preferences=["traditional_first", "evidence_based"]
)

treatment_plan = generate_hybrid_plan(patient)

# Output:
# {
#   "primary": "Acupuncture (Level 1 evidence for chronic pain)",
#   "complementary": "Herbal formula: Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang",
#   "biomedical": "NSAIDs as needed for breakthrough pain",
#   "integrative": "Physical therapy + Tai Chi (Level 1 evidence)"
# }
```

### Pharmacovigilance

The system monitors for interactions between traditional and modern treatments:
- **Herb-drug interactions** — St. John's Wort + SSRIs
- **Additive effects** — Ginkgo + anticoagulants
- **Contraindications** — Pregnancy, surgery, chronic conditions

## WHO TCIM global library API

### Data access

The WHO TCIM Global Library provides structured access to validated traditional medicine knowledge:

```python
# Example API usage
import requests

def query_tcim_library(country, condition):
    response = requests.get(
        "https://apps.who.int/tcim/api/v1/query",
        params={
            "country": country,
            "condition": condition,
            "evidence_level": "validated",
            "language": "en"
        }
    )
    return response.json()
```
