## Key amendments

### Amendment 1: Pandemic emergency definition

**Pandemic emergency**: Public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) with widespread human-to-human transmission across multiple WHO regions.

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import PandemicEmergencyDetector

detector = PandemicEmergencyDetector()

# Detect pandemic emergency
status = detector.assess_pandemic_status(
    disease="cholera",
    transmission_pattern="human_to_human",
    affected_regions=["AFRO", "EMRO", "SEARO"],
    case_count=150000,
    mortality_rate=0.02
)

if status.is_pandemic_emergency:
    # Trigger automatic activation of equity provisions
    detector.activate_equity_provisions()
    print("🚨 Pandemic emergency declared - Equity framework activated")
```

### Amendment 2: Equity framework

Mandatory equity assessment in PHEIC declaration with allocation framework for diagnostics/therapeutics/vaccines.

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import EquityAssessmentEngine

equity = EquityAssessmentEngine()

# Assess equity in vaccine distribution
assessment = equity.assess_distribution_equity(
    resource="cholera_vaccine",
    distribution_data={
        "high_income": 80000,
        "upper_middle_income": 45000,
        "lower_middle_income": 20000,
        "low_income": 5000
    },
    population_data={
        "high_income": 1000000,
        "upper_middle_income": 2000000,
        "lower_middle_income": 3000000,
        "low_income": 4000000
    },
    risk_data={
        "high_income": 0.001,
        "upper_middle_income": 0.005,
        "lower_middle_income": 0.015,
        "low_income": 0.040
    }
)

print(f"Equity score: {assessment.equity_score}")  # 0.35 (inequitable)
print(f"Recommended reallocation: {assessment.recommended_reallocation}")

# Generate allocation framework
allocation = equity.generate_allocation_framework(
    resource="cholera_vaccine",
    total_available=150000,
    optimization_target="minimize_mortality"
)
```

### Amendment 3: Pathogen access and benefit-sharing

Standard Material Transfer Agreements with benefit-sharing including real-time access to pathogens, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, capacity building, and technology transfer.

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import PathogenBenefitSharing

pbs = PathogenBenefitSharing()

# Register pathogen contribution
contribution = pbs.register_pathogen_contribution(
    contributor="KENYA_MINISTRY_OF_HEALTH",
    pathogen="Vibrio cholerae O1",
    isolate_id="KE_2025_001",
    collection_date="2025-01-15",
    location="Dadaab",
    sequence_data="ATCG...",
    metadata={
        "patient_age": 35,
        "patient_sex": "F",
        "symptoms": ["diarrhea", "vomiting"],
        "outcome": "recovered"
    }
)

# Track benefits received
benefits = pbs.track_benefits(
    contributor="KENYA_MINISTRY_OF_HEALTH",
    pathogen_id="KE_2025_001"
)

print(f"Benefits received:")
print(f"  - Diagnostic kits: {benefits['diagnostic_kits']}")
print(f"  - Vaccine doses: {benefits['vaccine_doses']}")
print(f"  - Training programs: {benefits['training_programs']}")
print(f"  - Technology transfers: {benefits['technology_transfers']}")
```

### Amendment 4: Compliance committee

Standing Committee on IHR Compliance with peer review mechanism for State Party core capacity implementation.

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import ComplianceCommittee

committee = ComplianceCommittee()

# Submit self-assessment
assessment = committee.submit_self_assessment(
    state_party="KENYA",
    year=2025,
    core_capacities={
        "legislation_policy": 4,  # 1-5 scale

# Receive technical assistance
assistance = committee.request_technical_assistance(
    state_party="KENYA",
    capacity_gap="laboratory_capacity",
    funding_requested=500000
)
```

### Amendment 6: WHO Hub for Pandemic Intelligence

Formal establishment with data collection/analysis, early warning, scenario planning, and support to State Parties.

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import WHOHubIntegration

## iLuminara implementation

### Equity assessment algorithms

```python
from edge_node.ai_agents import EquityMonitoringAgent

agent = EquityMonitoringAgent(
    location="KENYA",
    population_size=50000000
)

# Monitor diagnostic distribution
equity_metrics = agent.monitor_diagnostic_distribution(
    diagnostic="cholera_rapid_test",
    distribution_data=distribution_by_county,
    socioeconomic_data=income_by_county,
    risk_data=cholera_incidence_by_county
)

if equity_metrics.gini_coefficient > 0.4:
    print(f"⚠️ Inequitable distribution detected")
    print(f"Gini coefficient: {equity_metrics.gini_coefficient}")
    
    # Generate reallocation recommendation
    reallocation = agent.recommend_reallocation(
        current_distribution=distribution_by_county,
        optimization_target="minimize_inequity"
    )
```

### Federated learning for sovereignty

```python
from edge_node.ai_agents import FederatedLearningClient

# Kenya maintains data sovereignty
kenya_client = FederatedLearningClient(
    name="KENYA_MOH",
    epsilon=1.0,  # Privacy budget
    delta=1e-5
)

# Train on local data (never leaves Kenya)
kenya_client.train_local_model(
    training_data=kenya_cholera_cases,
    epochs=5
)

# Share privacy-preserving update with WHO Hub
update = kenya_client.get_model_update(apply_privacy=True)

# WHO Hub aggregates without accessing raw data
who_hub.aggregate_updates([
    kenya_update,
    tanzania_update,
    uganda_update
])

# Receive improved global model
kenya_client.apply_global_model(who_hub.global_model)
```

### Benefit-sharing ledger

```python
from edge_node.sync_protocol.golden_thread import GoldenThread

gt = GoldenThread()

# Record pathogen contribution
gt.record_pathogen_contribution(
    contributor="KENYA_MOH",
    pathogen_id="KE_2025_001",
    sequence_data_hash="sha256:abc123...",
    metadata_encrypted=True
)

# Record benefit received
gt.record_benefit_received(
    contributor="KENYA_MOH",
    pathogen_id="KE_2025_001",
    benefit_type="vaccine_doses",
    quantity=50000,
    value_usd=250000,
    provider="GAVI"
)

# Calculate benefit-sharing ratio
ratio = gt.calculate_benefit_sharing_ratio(
    contributor="KENYA_MOH",
    time_period="2025-Q1"
)

print(f"Pathogen contributions: {ratio.contributions}")
print(f"Benefits received: {ratio.benefits}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio.ratio}")  # Should approach 1.0 for equity
```

## Compliance dashboard

```python
from governance_kernel.ihr import IHRComplianceDashboard

dashboard = IHRComplianceDashboard()

# Get compliance status
status = dashboard.get_compliance_status(
    state_party="KENYA",
    amendments=[
        "PANDEMIC_EMERGENCY",
        "EQUITY_FRAMEWORK",
        "PATHOGEN_BENEFIT_SHARING",
        "COMPLIANCE_COMMITTEE",
        "WHO_HUB",
        "ONE_HEALTH"
    ]
)

print(f"Overall compliance: {status.overall_score}/100")
print(f"Amendments compliant: {status.compliant_count}/10")
print(f"Pending actions: {status.pending_actions}")
```
