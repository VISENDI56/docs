## Use case matrix

Real-world applications of deep-tech engines in Dadaab 2026:

| Technical Singularity | Real-World Use Case | Impact |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **BioNeMo** | Drug-resistant cholera strain appears → Design protein binder on edge server | Sovereign bio-defense: Hours instead of months |
| **cuOpt** | Flash floods cut road → Re-calculate drone paths in 150ms | Resilient supply chain: 99% uptime for life-saving drugs |
| **Riva** | Somali grandmother describes symptoms using idioms → Translate to SNOMED-CT | Cultural safety: 40% reduction in misdiagnosis |
| **GeoGhost** | Internet blackout during sandstorm → Identify sanitation risks offline | Zero-downtime operations: Health surveillance continues |
| **Shirika Equity Engine** | New water borehole drilled → Calculate fair usage schedule | Social cohesion: Prevents resource-based violence |

## The Shirika Plan integration

iLuminara-Core directly supports the Shirika Plan's objectives:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Urban integration">
    Omniverse Digital Twin enables camp-to-city transformation without displacement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Economic inclusion">
    Water-ATM and ReFi substrate create local circular economy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Education access">
    Knowledge Mesh provides CBC-aligned education to 100,000+ students
  </Step>
  <Step title="Food security">
    Agro-Voltaics solves food and energy insecurity simultaneously
  </Step>
  <Step title="Legal empowerment">
    Tele-Justice provides access to legal representation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dadaab transformation

**Context:** 200,000 refugees, 5,000 hectares, arid climate

**Deployment:**
- 50 Omniverse planning nodes
- 200 Knowledge Mesh tablets
- 10 hectares agro-voltaic farms
- 30 Water-ATM stations
- 5 Tele-Justice terminals

**Impact:**
- 95% education access
- 80% food self-sufficiency
- 100% clean water access
- Legal representation for all

### Scenario 2: Kalobeyei integrated settlement

**Context:** 40,000 residents (refugees + host community), 1,500 hectares

**Deployment:**
- Integrated urban planning with host community
