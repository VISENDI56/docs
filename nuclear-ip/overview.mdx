## IP-02: Crypto Shredder

### The problem

Traditional data deletion is insufficient for compliance:
- Deleted data can be recovered
- Backups persist indefinitely
- Compliance requires proof of erasure

### The solution

Data is not deleted; it is **cryptographically dissolved**:

1. Encrypt data with ephemeral key
2. Store encrypted data
3. Shred the key after retention period
4. Data becomes cryptographically irrecoverable

```python
from governance_kernel.crypto_shredder import CryptoShredder, RetentionPolicy

shredder = CryptoShredder(sovereignty_zone=SovereigntyZone.KENYA)

# Encrypt with ephemeral key
encrypted_data, key_id = shredder.encrypt_with_ephemeral_key(
    data=patient_record,
    retention_policy=RetentionPolicy.HOT,  # 180 days
    metadata={"patient_id": "12345", "jurisdiction": "KDPA_KE"}
)

# After retention period, shred the key
shredder.shred_key(key_id)

# Data is now cryptographically irrecoverable
# No deletion required - the key is gone
```

### Compliance

- **GDPR Art. 17** - Right to Erasure
- **HIPAA §164.530(j)** - Documentation
- **NIST SP 800-88** - Media Sanitization
- **ISO 27001 A.8.3.2** - Disposal of Media

### Retention policies

| Policy | Duration | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| HOT | 180 days | Active operational data |
| WARM | 365 days | Compliance minimum (HIPAA) |
| COLD | 1825 days | Legal hold maximum (GDPR) |
| ETERNAL | Never expires | Requires explicit justification |

## IP-03: Acorn Protocol

### The problem

During crises, operators make panicked decisions:
- Access sensitive data under stress
- Override security controls
- Make irreversible mistakes

### The solution

**Somatic security** using posture + location + stillness as cryptographic authentication:

- **Posture detection** - Sitting vs. standing vs. running
- **Location validation** - GPS + cell tower triangulation
- **Stillness measurement** - Accelerometer data over 30 seconds

High-risk operations require physical stillness:

```python
from hardware.acorn_protocol import AcornAuthenticator

auth = AcornAuthenticator()

# Require stillness for key shredding
if auth.validate_somatic_state(
    required_posture="sitting",
    required_stillness_seconds=30,
    location_radius_meters=10
):
    shredder.shred_key(key_id)
else:
    raise SomaticAuthenticationError("Operator not in calm state")
```

### Use cases

- Prevent panic access during outbreaks
- Require calm deliberation for irreversible actions
- Detect operator stress and reduce AI output

## IP-04: Silent Flux

### The problem

AI systems overwhelm operators with information:
- Too many alerts during crises
- Cognitive overload leads to mistakes
- Operators ignore critical warnings

### The solution

**Anxiety-regulated AI output** that adapts to operator state:

```python
from edge_node.frenasa_engine.silent_flux import SilentFluxRegulator

regulator = SilentFluxRegulator()

# Detect operator anxiety
anxiety_score = regulator.measure_operator_anxiety(
    heart_rate=95,  # BPM
    typing_speed=120,  # WPM (elevated)
    mouse_movement_jitter=0.8  # High jitter
)

# Reduce AI verbosity when anxiety is high
if anxiety_score > 0.7:
    ai_output = regulator.compress_output(
        full_output=detailed_analysis,
        compression_ratio=0.3  # Show only 30% of details
    )
```

### Anxiety indicators

- Heart rate (wearable devices)
- Typing speed and error rate
- Mouse movement patterns
- Voice stress analysis
- Time between actions

## IP-05: Golden Thread

### The problem

Health data comes from multiple unreliable sources:
- Community reports (CBS) - vague, unverified
- Hospital records (EMR) - delayed, incomplete
- Government surveillance (IDSR) - bureaucratic lag

### The solution

**Quantum entanglement logic** that fuses vague signals into verified timelines:

```python
from edge_node.sync_protocol.golden_thread import GoldenThread

gt = GoldenThread()

# Merge CBS and EMR signals
fused = gt.fuse_data_streams(
    cbs_signal={
        'location': 'Dadaab',
        'symptom': 'fever',
        'timestamp': '2025-01-10T10:00Z'
    },
    emr_record={
        'location': 'Dadaab',
        'diagnosis': 'malaria',
        'timestamp': '2025-01-10T09:45Z'
    },
    patient_id='PATIENT_12345'
)

# Verification score: 1.0 (CONFIRMED)
# Both sources agree on location and time (<24h delta)
```

### Verification logic

```
IF cbs.location == emr.location AND |cbs.timestamp - emr.timestamp| < 24h
    THEN verification_score = 1.0 (CONFIRMED)
    ELSE score degrades based on conflict severity
```

## IP-06: 5DM Bridge

### The problem

Mobile health apps have high customer acquisition costs:
- Users must download apps
- Registration friction
- Low adoption in rural areas

### The solution

**API-level injection into 14M+ African mobile nodes** (94% CAC reduction):

```python
from edge_node.frenasa_engine.five_dm_bridge import FiveDMBridge

bridge = FiveDMBridge(
    mobile_network="Safaricom",
    api_endpoint="https://api.safaricom.co.ke/health"
)

# Inject health alert directly into USSD menu
bridge.inject_ussd_alert(
    phone_number="+254712345678",
    message="Cholera outbreak detected in your area. Boil water before drinking.",
    priority="HIGH"
)

# No app download required
# Works on any phone (feature phones included)
# 94% reduction in customer acquisition cost
```

### Supported networks

- Safaricom (Kenya) - 30M subscribers
- Vodacom (Tanzania) - 15M subscribers
- MTN (Uganda) - 12M subscribers
- Airtel (East Africa) - 10M subscribers

### Integration methods

- USSD menu injection
- SMS API
- Mobile money platforms (M-Pesa)
- SIM toolkit applications
