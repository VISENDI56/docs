## The paradigm shift

iLuminara-Core has evolved from a **Reactive Tool** (which waits for user input) to an **Active Inference Engine** (which predicts and acts).

## From reactive to predictive

### Traditional health systems (reactive)

```
Outbreak occurs → Detect → Respond → Contain
```

**Problem:** Always one step behind the virus

### iLuminara cognitive system (predictive)

```
Simulate 10,000 futures → Identify optimal path → Pre-position resources → Prevent outbreak
```

**Advantage:** Always one step ahead of the virus

## Invention 1: Project Causal-Twin

**The DeepMind Insight:** Don't test health policies on real people. Test them on a "Digital Twin" of Nairobi.

### What it does

- Simulates 10,000+ virtual citizens moving, interacting, and spreading viruses
- Tests intervention strategies (lockdowns, vaccinations, testing) in parallel universes
- Identifies optimal policies before deploying in reality

### Key capabilities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent-Based Modeling">
    Each virtual citizen has age, mobility, compliance, and health state
  </Step>
  <Step title="SEIRD dynamics">
    Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Recovered/Deceased
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intervention testing">
    Lockdowns, vaccinations, testing, contact tracing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome prediction">
    Attack rate, mortality, peak day, economic cost
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example usage

```python
from simulation_engine.causal_twin import CausalTwinSimulation

# Initialize Digital Twin of Nairobi
sim = CausalTwinSimulation(
    population=10000,
    initial_infected=10,
    r0=2.5
)

# Test intervention strategy
for day in range(90):
    sim.step(
        lockdown_strength=0.5,
        vaccination_rate=0.01,
        testing_rate=0.1
    )

# Get results
metrics = sim.get_metrics()
print(f"Total cases: {metrics['total_cases']}")
print(f"Deaths: {metrics['deaths']}")
print(f"Attack rate: {metrics['attack_rate']:.1%}")
```

## Invention 2: Hammurabi-Zero

**The DeepMind Insight:** Laws are static code. Reality is dynamic.

### What it does

- Reinforcement Learning agent that drafts emergency policies
- Optimizes the balance between survival, civil unrest, and economic cost
- Learns from 1000+ simulated crises to find optimal interventions

### The reward function

```
R = α·SurvivalRate - β·CivilUnrest - γ·EconomicCost
```

Where:
- **α** (alpha) = Weight for survival (default: 1.0)
- **β** (beta) = Weight for civil unrest (default: 0.5)
- **γ** (gamma) = Weight for economic cost (default: 0.3)

### Policy types

| Type | Example | Survival | Unrest | Cost |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| Border Control | Selective closure | 75% | 30% | 40% |
| Movement Restriction | Targeted lockdown | 80% | 40% | 50% |
| Economic Support | Universal Basic Income | 65% | 10% | 80% |
| Healthcare Allocation | Triage protocol | 85% | 60% | 20% |
| Quarantine | Hotel quarantine | 90% | 50% | 60% |
| Vaccination Mandate | Vaccine passport | 92% | 70% | 30% |

### Example usage

```python
from rl_governance.hammurabi_agent import HammurabiAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = HammurabiAgent(alpha=1.0, beta=0.5, gamma=0.3)

# Current crisis state
crisis_state = {
    'infection_rate': 0.05,
    'hospital_capacity': 0.7,
    'public_compliance': 0.6
}

# Get optimal policy
policy = agent.propose_policy(crisis_state)

print(f"Recommended: {policy.name}")
print(f"Survival: {policy.survival_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Reward: {policy.reward:.3f}")
```

## Invention 3: Akashic Memory

**The DeepMind Insight:** Databases (SQL) can be deleted or corrupted. Neural Networks are resilient.

### What it does

- Stores patient records as weights in a neural network
- Data becomes "viral" - distributed across millions of parameters
- Cannot be extracted without the entire network
- GDPR erasure via weight pruning

### Architecture

```
Input: Patient ID (256-bit hash)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 1 (64 neurons)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 2 (64 neurons)
    ↓
Output: Patient Embedding (8-dimensional)
```

### Why this matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resilience">
    Destroying one weight doesn't destroy the data. The record is distributed across the entire network.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy">
    Data is encoded, not stored in plaintext. Requires the network to reconstruct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sovereignty">
    The network can be replicated across jurisdictions without moving raw data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compliance">
    GDPR Right to Erasure implemented via weight pruning, not deletion.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example usage

```python
from neural_memory.holographic_store import NeuralMemoryNetwork, PatientRecord

# Initialize network
network = NeuralMemoryNetwork()

# Store record (encodes into weights)
record = PatientRecord(
    patient_id="PAT_12345",
    blood_type="O+",
    age=35,
    location="Nairobi",
    diagnoses=["Malaria"],
    medications=["Artemether"],
    vital_signs={"temperature": 38.5, "heart_rate": 95}
)

network.store_record(record)

# Retrieve record (reconstructs from weights)
retrieved = network.retrieve_record("PAT_12345")

# Forget record (GDPR erasure via weight pruning)
network.forget_record("PAT_12345")
```

## The cognitive workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Simulation">
    Causal-Twin simulates 10,000 outbreak scenarios
  </Step>
  <Step title="Policy optimization">
    Hammurabi-Zero identifies optimal intervention strategy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment">
    Policy is deployed to governance kernel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data collection">
    Real-world outcomes are stored in Akashic Memory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learning">
    Agent learns from outcomes to improve future policies
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comparison to traditional systems

| **Data Storage** | SQL databases | Neural network weights |
| **Response Time** | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |
| **Learning** | Manual policy updates | Continuous RL training |
| **Sovereignty** | Data in foreign clouds | Distributed neural networks |
