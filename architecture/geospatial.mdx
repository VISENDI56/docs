description: The eyes—spatial intelligence for offline-first humanitarian operations
---

The ESRI Geospatial Layer provides spatial intelligence and real-time earth observation capabilities for disconnected environments.

## GeoGhost (Offline Spatial Inference)

### Deep Learning Packages (.dlpk)

AI models (like YOLOv8 or Mask R-CNN) trained in ArcGIS Pro are packaged into a single file containing:
- Model architecture
- Trained weights
- Pre-processing logic

### ArcGIS Runtime SDK (Native)

Runs directly on the edge device's metal (C++ core with Python bindings). Handles:
- **Vector tile rendering** (.vtpk)
- **Map package loading** (.mmpk)
- No browser or web server required

**Key Capability:** Full GIS functionality in completely disconnected environments.

```python
class GeoGhost:
    """
    Offline spatial inference for edge deployment.
    """
    def analyze_offline(self, location, dlpk_model):
        # Load deep learning package
        model = self.load_dlpk(dlpk_model)
        
        # Load offline map tiles
        basemap = self.load_vtpk(location)
        
        # Run inference
        features = model.detect(basemap)
        
        return features
```

## STAC Ingestion (Real-Time Earth Observation)

### Cloud-Native Geospatial

Instead of downloading huge TIF files, uses **HTTP Range Requests** to stream only the pixels needed for the specific area of interest (AOI).

### Dynamic Tiling

Generates map tiles on-the-fly from raw satellite data using **Dask** for parallel processing.

**Architecture:**
1. Query STAC catalog for relevant imagery
2. Stream only required pixels via HTTP range requests
3. Process in parallel using Dask
4. Generate tiles dynamically
5. Cache for offline use

### Use Cases

- **Flood monitoring:** Real-time water extent mapping
- **Vegetation health:** NDVI analysis for food security
- **Infrastructure damage:** Post-disaster assessment
- **Population movement:** Settlement expansion tracking

## Spatial Intelligence Pipeline

```python
class STACIngestion:
    """
    Real-time earth observation via STAC protocol.
    """
    def ingest_satellite_data(self, aoi, time_range):
        # Query STAC catalog
        items = self.stac_client.search(
            bbox=aoi,
            datetime=time_range,
            collections=['sentinel-2']
        )
        
        # Stream only required pixels
        pixels = self.stream_pixels(items, aoi)
        
        # Parallel processing with Dask
        tiles = self.dask_process(pixels)
        
        # Cache for offline use
        self.cache_tiles(tiles)
        
        return tiles
```

## Integration with AI Layers

### BioNeMo + Geospatial
Track disease vectors (mosquito breeding sites) via satellite imagery and target interventions.

### cuOpt + Geospatial
Route optimization using real-time terrain and infrastructure data.

### Modulus + Geospatial
Flood prediction models using elevation data and weather patterns.

## Key Differentiators

- **Offline-first:** Full GIS capabilities without connectivity
- **Cloud-native:** Efficient streaming of satellite data
- **AI-ready:** Deep learning packages for edge inference
- **Real-time:** Dynamic tile generation from live satellite feeds
- **Humanitarian-focused:** Optimized for crisis response and refugee operations
