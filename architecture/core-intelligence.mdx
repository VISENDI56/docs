description: Dual-Process Cognitive Architecture for planetary-scale reasoning
---

The Core Intelligence Layer is not a chatbot—it's a **Dual-Process Cognitive Architecture** engineered to replicate human "System 2" deliberate reasoning for clinical decision-making at the edge.

## Blitzy System 2 Reasoning Loop

### Evolutionary Reasoning Optimization (ERO)

Unlike standard RLHF, this module uses an evolutionary strategy that spawns a population of "thought paths" (genotypes) and applies a Survival of the Fittest function based on clinical safety guidelines.

**Architecture:**
- Spawns multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- Applies adversarial critique from specialized sub-models
- Only the reasoning path that survives critique reaches the user
- Trades latency for depth and safety

**Implementation:** `core/system2_reasoning/`

### Critic Agents

Specialized sub-models fine-tuned on medical guidelines (Merck Manuals, clinical protocols) that act as "Devil's Advocates."

**Function:**
- Attack the primary model's output
- Identify hallucinations before they reach the UI
- Enforce clinical safety constraints
- Validate against established medical knowledge

### Inference-Time Compute

The system performs **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Rollouts**, simulating 10–50 potential future outcomes of a diagnosis before selecting the statistically safest one.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Pass@1 Rate:** 86.8% on internal clinical benchmarks
- **Method:** Self-Consistency voting (majority vote across 100 reasoning paths)
- **Latency Trade-off:** Increased inference time for dramatically improved safety

## Autonomous Validation Loop (Self-Healing)

### Drift Detection

Uses **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence** to measure the statistical distance between training data and live input.

**Triggers:**
- New slang terms for medical conditions
- Regional dialect variations
- Emerging disease patterns
- Concept drift alerts

### Auto-Correction (Code-Gen)

When a test fails, an LLM agent:
1. Reads the stack trace
2. Accesses repository context
3. Generates a patch
4. Runs the test suite again
5. Only commits if verification passes

This is **Test-Driven Development (TDD) on Autopilot**.

## Clinical Safety Architecture

```python
class System2Reasoner:
    """
    Evolutionary reasoning with adversarial critique.
    """
    def reason(self, clinical_input):
        # Spawn population of thought paths
        paths = self.generate_reasoning_paths(clinical_input, n=100)
        
        # Apply critic agents
        surviving_paths = self.critic_filter(paths)
        
        # Self-consistency voting
        final_diagnosis = self.majority_vote(surviving_paths)
        
        return final_diagnosis
```

## Key Differentiators

- **Not a chatbot:** Deliberate, multi-step reasoning
- **Safety-first:** Multiple layers of adversarial validation
- **Self-healing:** Automatic drift detection and correction
- **Clinically validated:** 86.8% pass rate on medical benchmarks
