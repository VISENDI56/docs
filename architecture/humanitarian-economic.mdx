The Humanitarian & Economic Layer transforms iLuminara from a technical system into a force for human dignity and economic justice.

## Shirika Equity Engine

### Multi-Objective Optimization

Uses algorithms like **NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)** to find the "Pareto Frontier" of resource distribution—solutions where you cannot make the host community better off without making the refugees worse off (and vice versa).

**Goal:** Mathematical fairness that prevents conflict.

```python
class ShirikaEquityEngine:
    """
    Multi-objective optimization for conflict-free resource allocation.
    """
    def optimize_distribution(self, resources, populations):
        # Define objectives
        objectives = [
            self.maximize_host_satisfaction,
            self.maximize_refugee_satisfaction,
            self.minimize_environmental_impact
        ]
        
        # Find Pareto frontier using NSGA-II
        solutions = self.nsga2(objectives, resources, populations)
        
        # Select Nash equilibrium point
        optimal = self.select_nash_equilibrium(solutions)
        
        return optimal
```

### Key Metrics

- **Gini Coefficient:** Measures inequality
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Game-theoretic fairness
- **Pareto Efficiency:** No waste in allocation

## ReFi Tokenomics (Bio-Credits)

### Smart Contracts Architecture

Self-executing code on a private, permissioned ledger (**Hyperledger Besu**).

**Solidity/Vyper contracts:**
- Mint bio-credits for verified environmental actions
- Transfer credits for goods/services
- Burn credits for external currency exchange

### Oracle Integration

The contract listens to the **IoT Sentinel**. When the sensor detects "Water Quality = Safe," the Oracle triggers the contract to mint and transfer "Bio-Credits" to the CHV's wallet automatically.

```solidity
contract BioCredit {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function mintForWaterQuality(address chv, uint256 quality) external {
        require(msg.sender == oracleAddress, "Only oracle");
        require(quality >= SAFE_THRESHOLD, "Water not safe");
        
        uint256 credits = calculateCredits(quality);
        balances[chv] += credits;
        
        emit CreditsMinted(chv, credits, "WaterQuality");
    }
}
```

### Economic Sovereignty

- **No external dependency:** Credits generated locally
- **Transparent:** All transactions auditable
- **Programmable:** Rules encoded in smart contracts
- **Inclusive:** No bank account required

## ZKP Identity (Privacy Vault)

### zk-SNARKs Architecture

**Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge**

**Roles:**
- **Prover (Patient):** Generates a proof that "I have attribute X" (e.g., Age > 18)
- **Verifier (Clinic):** Mathematically verifies the proof is true without ever learning the input (Age)

### Circuit Compilation

The logic (e.g., eligibility rules) is compiled into a specific arithmetic circuit that the proof is run against.

```python
class ZKPIdentity:
    """
    Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving identity.
    """
    def prove_eligibility(self, patient_data, requirement):
        # Compile eligibility circuit
        circuit = self.compile_circuit(requirement)
        
        # Generate proof (patient side)
        proof = self.generate_proof(patient_data, circuit)
        
        # Verify proof (clinic side)
        is_eligible = self.verify_proof(proof, circuit)
        
        # Clinic learns eligibility, not data
        return is_eligible
```

### Use Cases

- **Age verification:** Prove age > 18 without revealing birthdate
- **Medical eligibility:** Prove vaccination status without revealing records
- **Identity verification:** Prove identity without revealing biometrics
- **Credential verification:** Prove qualifications without revealing documents

## TCIM Adapter (Traditional Knowledge)

### Knowledge Graph Mapping

Uses **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** to map local traditional concepts (e.g., "Muarubaini plant") to biomedical ontologies (e.g., "Azadirachta indica" → "Anti-inflammatory").

This allows the AI to "reason" across both knowledge systems.

```python
class TCIMAdapter:
    """
    Bridge between traditional and biomedical knowledge.
    """
    def map_traditional_remedy(self, local_name):
        # Query knowledge graph
        botanical = self.kg.query(f"SELECT ?plant WHERE {{
            ?plant tcim:localName '{local_name}' .
        }}")
        
        # Map to biomedical properties
        properties = self.kg.query(f"SELECT ?property WHERE {{
            {botanical} bio:hasProperty ?property .
        }}")
        
        return {
            'botanical': botanical,
            'properties': properties,
            'evidence_level': self.assess_evidence(botanical)
        }
```

### Respectful Integration

- **Preserves traditional knowledge:** Not replaced, integrated
- **Evidence-based:** Maps to scientific validation where available
- **Community-driven:** Local healers contribute to knowledge graph
- **Culturally sensitive:** Respects intellectual property and sacred knowledge

## Trustless Aid Supply Chain

### Atomic Physical-Digital Swaps

**IoT Sentinel + Smart Contracts:** The "Water ATM" or "Medicine Locker" physically cannot open unless the Bio-Credit transaction is verified on the blockchain.

**Result:** Corruption becomes physically impossible.

```python
class TrustlessAid:
    """
    Atomic swaps between physical goods and digital credits.
    """
    def dispense_aid(self, recipient_wallet, item_id):
        # Verify credits
        if not self.verify_credits(recipient_wallet, item_id):
            raise InsufficientCredits()
        
        # Deduct credits (blockchain)
        self.deduct_credits(recipient_wallet, item_id)
        
        # Unlock physical dispenser (IoT)
        self.iot_sentinel.unlock(item_id)
        
        # Log for audit trail
        self.log_transaction(recipient_wallet, item_id)
```

## Key Differentiators

- **Mathematical fairness:** Pareto-optimal resource allocation
- **Economic sovereignty:** Local currency generation
- **Privacy-preserving:** Zero-knowledge identity
- **Culturally respectful:** Traditional knowledge integration
- **Corruption-proof:** Atomic physical-digital swaps
