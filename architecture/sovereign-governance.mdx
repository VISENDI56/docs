title: Sovereign Governance Layer
description: The conscience—47 frameworks of legal, ethical, and moral compliance
---

The Sovereign Governance Layer ensures that every action taken by iLuminara complies with international law, ethical principles, and humanitarian standards.

## Omni-Law Matrix (47 Frameworks)

### Logic Gates Architecture

Each legal framework is decomposed into a set of **boolean logic checks**:
- `is_pii_encrypted()`
- `is_consent_verified()`
- `is_gdpr_compliant()`
- `is_refugee_convention_compliant()`

### Execution Graph

Before any "unsafe" function (e.g., `drone_dispatch`) is called, the `@sovereign_guardrail` decorator intercepts the call, runs the 47-check matrix, and raises a blocking exception if any check fails.

```python
@sovereign_guardrail(frameworks=['GDPR', 'RefugeeConvention', 'IEC61508'])
def dispatch_medical_drone(patient_id, medication):
    """
    Cannot execute unless all 47 legal checks pass.
    """
    # This code only runs if legally compliant
    drone.deliver(patient_id, medication)
```

### Covered Frameworks

- **Data Protection:** GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA
- **Humanitarian Law:** 1951 Refugee Convention, Geneva Conventions
- **Safety Standards:** IEC 61508, ISO 26262
- **Medical Ethics:** Helsinki Declaration, Belmont Report
- **AI Ethics:** EU AI Act, UNESCO AI Ethics
- **Environmental:** Paris Agreement, CBD
- **And 37 more...**

## Moral Governor (Constitutional AI)

### Constitutional Training

Based on **Anthropic's CAI**. The model is trained/prompted with a "Constitution" (a set of ethical principles). During inference, it generates a critique of its own response based on these principles and revises it.

### RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)

Instead of human labelers, an AI model uses the Constitution to generate preferences for training the main model.

**Process:**
1. Model generates response
2. Constitutional critic evaluates response
3. Model revises based on critique
4. Final response is ethically aligned

```python
class MoralGovernor:
    """
    Constitutional AI for ethical decision-making.
    """
    def govern(self, proposed_action):
        # Generate initial response
        response = self.model.generate(proposed_action)
        
        # Constitutional critique
        critique = self.critic.evaluate(response, self.constitution)
        
        # Revise if needed
        if not critique.is_ethical:
            response = self.model.revise(response, critique)
        
        return response
```

## PABS Protocol (Pathogen Sovereignty)

### Federated Learning Architecture

Instead of moving data, the **model moves to the data**. The "Global Model" sends weights to the "Local Clinic." The clinic trains on local genomic data and sends back only the updated weights (gradients), ensuring the raw pathogen DNA sequence never leaves the sovereign territory.

**Process:**
1. Global model distributed to edge nodes
2. Local training on sensitive pathogen data
3. Only gradients sent back to central server
4. Raw genomic data never leaves local jurisdiction

### Data Sovereignty Guarantees

- **No data exfiltration:** Pathogen sequences stay local
- **Differential privacy:** Gradients are noise-injected
- **Cryptographic verification:** Secure aggregation protocols
- **Audit trails:** Every model update is logged

## Legal Singularity (Automated Justice)

### Confidential Legal Enclaves

A Legal-LLM trained on the 1951 Refugee Convention, running inside a **Confidential Computing (TEE)** enclave. It autonomously:
- Documents violations
- Collects evidence (via IoT/Drones)
- Files valid legal claims to UNHCR/ICC

### Architecture

```python
class LegalSingularity:
    """
    Automated legal representation for the dispossessed.
    """
    def document_violation(self, incident):
        # Collect evidence
        evidence = self.gather_evidence(incident)
        
        # Legal analysis in TEE
        with self.confidential_enclave:
            case = self.legal_llm.analyze(evidence)
            
        # File claim if valid
        if case.is_valid:
            self.file_claim(case, jurisdiction='ICC')
```

## Key Differentiators

- **47 legal frameworks:** Comprehensive compliance matrix
- **Constitutional AI:** Self-critiquing ethical reasoning
- **Federated learning:** Data sovereignty for sensitive genomic data
- **Automated justice:** Legal representation at scale
- **Hardware-enforced:** Safety guarantees at the silicon level
