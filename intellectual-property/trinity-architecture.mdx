# Core architecture

The iLuminara-Core system is built on four foundational components that provide autonomous operation, accountability, security, and financial sustainability.

## Component 1: Recursive Sovereign Architect (RSA)

### Overview

The RSA is an autonomous code management system that monitors and adapts the iLuminara stack in response to hardware changes and regulatory updates.

### Technical implementation

The RSA uses a language-agnostic hierarchical relational index to understand repository structure and dependencies. It achieves an 86.8% Pass@1 success rate for complex, repository-scale modifications.

### Core capabilities

**Autonomous regulatory refactoring**

The RSA monitors external legal feeds for changes in registered frameworks. When changes are detected:

- Identifies impacted functions via the hierarchical index
- Generates compliance-preserving patches
- Validates patches using Z3 formal verification
- Deploys updates after verification

**Hardware optimization**

The RSA identifies available hardware resources and optimizes code accordingly. For example, when NVIDIA Blackwell B300 hardware is available, the system refactors compute-intensive operations to use FP4/FP8 precision for improved performance.

**Self-healing**

The system simulates potential failures, generates fixes, and validates them in a closed-loop environment before deployment.

## Component 2: Sovereign Trace-Back Kernel (STBK)

### Overview

The STBK provides complete traceability for system decisions by mapping every action back to its legal authorization, data sources, and execution context.

### Technical implementation

The STBK generates cryptographic receipts that bind three vectors:

1. **Input data:** SHA-256 hash of source data
2. **Legal authorization:** Z3 proof ID and statute reference
3. **Execution context:** Hardware location and compute resources used

Each receipt is signed with post-quantum cryptographic signatures and stored in an immutable append-only log.

### Core capabilities

**Complete traceability**

Every system action is logged with:
- Legal framework authorization
- Environmental conditions at execution time
- Data sources used for decision-making
- Reasoning chain that led to the action
- Nanosecond-precision timestamp
- Cryptographic seal preventing tampering

**Real-time auditing**

Audit queries return results in under 100ms, even with over 1 million receipts. This enables real-time forensic analysis for institutional partners.

**Compliance verification**

The STBK automatically verifies that every action complies with registered legal frameworks, providing audit trails for regulatory reporting.

## Component 3: Polymorphic Bio-Lock Shield (PBLS)

### Overview

The PBLS provides multi-factor authentication with rotating cryptographic keys to prevent unauthorized access and code cloning.

### Technical implementation

The system generates authentication keys from three sources:

1. **Biometric authentication:** Via Entra ID
2. **Compliance state:** From the Omni-Law Matrix
3. **Hardware fingerprint:** NVIDIA Blackwell PUF

Keys rotate every 18ms, creating a dynamic authentication target.

### Core capabilities

**Polymorphic key generation**

Continuous key rotation makes brute-force attacks impractical by creating a constantly moving authentication target.

**Triple-factor authentication**

The system requires all three authentication factors to operate. If any factor fails verification, the system triggers a shutdown sequence.

**Hardware binding**

The system is cryptographically bound to specific hardware. Attempts to run on unauthorized hardware trigger automatic shutdown.

## Component 4: Capital-Mesh Equity Ledger

### Overview

The Capital-Mesh provides algorithmic, real-time valuation based on operational performance metrics.

### Technical implementation

The system links nominal capital (KES 100,000 for 100 shares) to operational metrics:

- Active compute nodes
- Impact-based revenue
- Data residency compliance

Valuation updates every 18ms based on network telemetry.

```
Total_Valuation = Nominal_Capital + Annualized_Revenue + Infrastructure_Value

Where:
- Annualized_Revenue = (Daily_Savings_USD × 365) × Exchange_Rate
- Infrastructure_Value = Active_Nodes × Hardware_Value_Per_Node
- Dynamic_Share_Price = Total_Valuation / 100
```

### Core capabilities

**Real-time valuation**

Share price updates continuously based on operational performance, providing transparent valuation for stakeholders.

**Dual-entity attribution**

The system automatically attributes value across the corporate structure:
- Minnesota LLC: IP ownership and licensing revenue
- Kenya PVT: Operational revenue and hardware assets

**Automated dividend calculation**

The system calculates profit distribution based on operating agreement terms:
- 70% retained for growth
- 30% distributable to shareholders

**Compliance-weighted pricing**

Share price adjusts based on legal compliance status:
- Full compliance (47/47 frameworks): 1.0x multiplier
- Partial compliance: 0.8x multiplier
- Non-compliance: 0.5x multiplier with audit trigger

## Unified architecture

These four components work together to create an autonomous system:

1. **RSA** - Maintains and optimizes the codebase
2. **STBK** - Provides accountability and traceability
3. **PBLS** - Ensures security and access control
4. **Capital-Mesh** - Converts operational performance into equity value
