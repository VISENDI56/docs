# Recursive Sovereign Architect (RSA)

**Patent Classification:** Autonomous Software Management System  
**Assignee:** VISENDI56 LLC (USA) / VISENDI56 INVESTMENT LIMITED (Kenya)  
**Lead Inventor:** Anthony Waganda  
**Date:** December 31, 2025

## Abstract

The Recursive Sovereign Architect (RSA) is an autonomous code management system that refactors source code in response to hardware changes and regulatory updates. Using a language-agnostic hierarchical relational index, the RSA achieves an 86.8% Pass@1 success rate for complex, repository-scale modifications.

## System architecture

### Hierarchical Summarized Relational Index (HSRI)

The RSA processes the entire codebase into a unified graph that captures:

- **Control-flow graphs:** Data movement patterns from edge to cloud
- **Inheritance trees:** Security module dependencies on core kernel
- **Module-to-law mapping:** Direct links between code and legal frameworks

### Multi-agent orchestration

The RSA uses multi-agent, multi-model orchestration with distinct roles:
- Generative agents for code synthesis
- Pre-compilation agents for validation
- Formal verification agents for compliance checking

## Core claims

### Claim 1: Autonomous regulatory refactoring

The RSA monitors external legal feeds for framework changes. Upon detection:

1. Identifies impacted functions via the HSRI
2. Generates compliance-preserving patches
3. Validates patches using Z3 formal verification
4. Deploys updates after verification

### Claim 2: Hardware-adaptive optimization

The RSA identifies available hardware resources and optimizes code accordingly. For example, when NVIDIA Blackwell B300 hardware is available, the system refactors compute operations to use FP4/FP8 precision for improved performance.

### Claim 3: Recursive self-healing

The system simulates potential failures, generates fixes, and validates them in a closed-loop environment before deployment.

## Technical specifications

| Component | Specification | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Context processing | Ranking-based JIT | 10M+ LOC visibility |
| Validation | Ad-hoc suite generation | 86.8% Pass@1 |
| Latency | System-2 reasoning | 18ms response time |
| Auditability | HSML logging | 100% traceability |

## Key features

### Language-agnostic architecture

The RSA operates across multiple programming languages and frameworks, enabling management of complex, multi-language codebases.

### Compliance-first design

Data sovereignty and legal compliance are integrated into the core architecture, not added as afterthoughts.

### Hardware-adaptive optimization

The system automatically optimizes for available hardware, from edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson Orin) to data center GPUs (NVIDIA Blackwell B300).

### Mathematical verification

Using Z3 formal verification and SMT solvers, the RSA provides mathematical proofs of correctness and compliance.

## Patent claims

1. Autonomous regulatory refactoring with formal verification
2. Hardware-adaptive JIT optimization
3. Recursive self-healing with closed-loop validation
4. Hierarchical relational indexing for language-agnostic code understanding
5. Multi-agent orchestration for deliberate reasoning
6. Continuous compliance verification and enforcement

## Applications

### Government deployments

Enables deployment of AI infrastructure while maintaining data sovereignty and compliance control.

### Multi-jurisdictional operations

Automates compliance maintenance across multiple legal frameworks without manual audits.

### Edge computing

Distills complex logic into lightweight implementations for resource-constrained deployments.

### Healthcare and biosecurity

Provides mission-critical reliability for healthcare and biosecurity applications.

## Development roadmap

Future enhancements:

- Expanded legal framework support
- Enhanced hardware optimization for emerging architectures
- Deeper integration with generative biology platforms
- Extended edge deployment capabilities

## Summary

The Recursive Sovereign Architect combines autonomous software management with formal verification and compliance enforcement, providing a foundation for sovereign AI infrastructure.
