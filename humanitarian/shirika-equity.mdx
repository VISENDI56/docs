description: Multi-agent fairness logic for host-refugee resource integration in Dadaab and Kalobeyei
---

## Overview

The Shirika Municipal Oracle implements Multi-Agent Fairness Logic (MAFL) to autonomously balance resource distribution between host communities and refugee settlements in Kenya's integrated municipalities. Designed for the 2026 Shirika Plan transition, it ensures equitable allocation of vaccines, water, and medical supplies while preventing social friction.

## Quick start

```python
from core.humanitarian_logic.shirika_equity import ShirikaEquity

# Initialize equity engine
equity = ShirikaEquity()

# Calculate fair share between communities
allocation = equity.calculate_fair_share(
    community_a_needs=1500,  # Host community needs
    community_b_needs=2500   # Refugee settlement needs
)

print(f"Host share: {allocation['host_share']:.2%}")
print(f"Refugee share: {allocation['refugee_share']:.2%}")
```

## Multi-agent fairness logic

The MAFL algorithm balances competing needs using proportional allocation:

```python
# Advanced fairness with priority weighting
allocation = equity.calculate_weighted_fair_share(
    communities=[
        {"name": "Kalobeyei_Host", "needs": 1500, "priority": 1.0},
        {"name": "Kalobeyei_Settlement", "needs": 2500, "priority": 1.2},
        {"name": "Kakuma_Host", "needs": 800, "priority": 1.0}
    ],
    total_resources=5000
)

# Monitor social cohesion
friction_score = equity.assess_friction_risk(allocation)
if friction_score > 0.7:
    equity.trigger_mediation_protocol()
```

## Integration with cuOpt

Shirika Equity integrates with NVIDIA cuOpt for supply chain optimization:

```python
from integrations.nvidia_cuopt import SupplyChainOptimizer

# Optimize distribution routes
optimizer = SupplyChainOptimizer()
routes = optimizer.plan_delivery(
    allocation=allocation,
    depot_location="Dadaab_Central",
    vehicle_capacity=1000,
    time_windows=[(8, 17)]  # 8 AM to 5 PM
)
```

## Transparent reporting

Real-time dashboards provide visibility to stakeholders:

```python
# Generate transparency report
report = equity.generate_transparency_report(
    allocation=allocation,
    period="2026-Q1",
    stakeholders=["UNHCR", "Kenya_MOH", "Turkana_County"]
)

# Export to ESRI ArcGIS for geospatial visualization
equity.export_to_arcgis(report, layer="Shirika_Equity_2026")
```

## Use cases

### Vaccine distribution

```python
# Allocate COVID-19 vaccines during outbreak
vaccine_allocation = equity.allocate_medical_supplies(
    supply_type="vaccine_covid19",
    total_doses=10000,
    communities=["Dadaab_Host", "Dadaab_Refugee"],
    vulnerability_factors={
        "age_over_60": 1.5,
        "chronic_conditions": 1.3,
        "healthcare_access": 0.8
    }
)
```

### Water resource management

```python
# Balance water distribution during drought
water_allocation = equity.allocate_water_resources(
    total_liters=500000,
    communities=["Kalobeyei_Host", "Kalobeyei_Settlement"],
    consumption_patterns={
        "domestic": 0.6,
        "livestock": 0.3,
        "agriculture": 0.1
    }
)
```
